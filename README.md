# What I learned this project?

- Preplanning is the most important thing. I'd rather spend 3 hours thinking about how I'd structure my project than spend 20 hours trying to fix everything after it's already built.
- Algorithm. Minmax is an important algorithm that sheds alot of light about how recursion works and how to utilize it.
